Expression-Calculator
=====================

Expression calculator is a java parameterized expression evaluator program. Where you can evaluate a  mathematical expression  containing  variables  and constants at run time.You can pass the values to these variables at run time using hashmap where key will be the variable name and value of the hashmap corresponding to the key will be the value to that expression  variable.
       Expression evaluator is designed  using design pattern where expression parsing and evaluation iare abstracted  each other so that it will parse the expression one time and it can evaluate any number of times. At the time of evaluation it will not parse the expression. This utility can be used in any of your application where you need to evaluate a mathematical expression.
